<p>Exercise is a body activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.[1]

    It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improve health,[2] or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.
    
    In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.

    Physical fitness isn’t just about lifting heavy metal; it’s about how strong you are in relation to your body weight, says Martin Rooney, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the author of Ultimate Warrior Workouts. That’s why he has the athletes he trains perform body-weight tests. And if they struggle, he knows that they need to either gain more strength – or lose some weight.
